# Niro

## What is Niro?

Niro is an AI-powered pentest agent. It runs test cases against your
authorized targets and returns the coverage map: which passed, which
failed (the bugs, with runnable PoCs), which were blocked waiting on
your input.

You don't invoke Niro directly. Your coding agent calls Niro (over MCP)
automatically after each push to a PR. Niro returns bugs; your agent
writes a regression test that fails on the unfixed code, drafts a fix
that makes it pass, re-runs to confirm closure, and surfaces any blocked
items as a punch-list. You review the diff and the punch-list, provide
what's needed, merge.

## How do I setup Niro?

- `niro.yaml` — Niro's runtime knobs (defaults are sensible; tweak only when needed).
- `scope.yaml` — your authorization for what Niro may have access to (must be set before first run).
- `credentials.yaml.example` — example credentials file (read before producing your own `credentials.yaml`).
- `fixtures.yaml.example` — example fixture-reference file (read before producing your own `fixtures.yaml`).
- `accepted-behaviors.yaml.example` — example risk-acceptance register.
  Copy to `accepted-behaviors.yaml` only for specific by-design behavior
  you want Niro to account for.
- `accepted-coverage-gaps.yaml.example` — example known coverage
  limitation register. Copy to `accepted-coverage-gaps.yaml` only for specific
  gaps Niro should not re-report every run.

## How do I block merge until Niro passes?

Every Niro pentest writes a `Security / Niro` status check on the PR's
head commit alongside the canonical comment. Add this check to your
branch protection rule so no PR merges with unaddressed security
issues — Niro must have run, finished, and passed before GitHub will
let the merge button enable.

You configure this on GitHub yourself; Niro doesn't modify your repo
settings.

1. Open your repo on github.com.
2. **Settings** → **Branches**.
3. Click **Add branch protection rule** (or edit the existing rule
   for your default branch).
4. Branch name pattern: `main` (or whatever your protected branch is).
5. Check **Require status checks to pass before merging**, add
   `Security / Niro` to the required-checks list, and save.

One-time per project:

- Restart your coding agent after `niro init` so it picks up the generated
  MCP config (`.mcp.json` and, for Codex, `.codex/config.toml`).
- Codex users: if Codex asks you to review repo-local hooks, open `/hooks`
  and trust the generated Niro hook before expecting automatic PR nudges.
- Codex users: make sure `codex` is on `PATH`, or set
  `NIRO_CODEX_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/codex` before starting your agent.
  Run `codex login` first if the CLI is not already authenticated. When both
  the outer coding agent and Niro's inner reasoner are Codex, both sessions may
  draw from the same Codex account quota.
- Define what's in scope: edit `scope.yaml` (in-file comments explain
  the format and the per-environment-config rule).
- Create `niro/credentials.yaml` if your targets require auth — see
  `credentials.yaml.example` for the format and for sample shell
  recipes to populate it from your secrets backend (1Password,
  Doppler, Vault, plain heredoc, etc.). The file is gitignored by
  default; keep it that way.
- Create `niro/fixtures.yaml` if your target has seeded or known
  scenario state — see `fixtures.yaml.example` for the envelope-only
  format and sample seed-script recipes. The file is gitignored by
  default because fixture references get stale easily. Keep secrets in
  `credentials.yaml`, not fixtures.
- If the app has known by-design security tradeoffs, copy
  `accepted-behaviors.yaml.example` to `accepted-behaviors.yaml` and add
  entries for the specific accepted behaviors.
- If you have specific known gaps Niro cannot test in this setup, copy
  `accepted-coverage-gaps.yaml.example` to `accepted-coverage-gaps.yaml` and
  add entries naming those gaps.
- Tune resource caps if needed: edit `niro.yaml`.
